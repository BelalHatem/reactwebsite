## üí¨ Reflection

I found this project both interesting and challenging, as it allowed me to apply a variety of front-end development skills in a real-world context. From integrating animations and responsive layouts to embedding a fully functional game, every part of this site pushed me to learn and improve. I especially enjoyed creating something that not only highlights my technical abilities but also reflects a bit of my personality, creativity, and interests. Overall, it was a fun and rewarding experience building a space that's uniquely mine.
